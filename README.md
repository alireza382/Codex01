# Face Swap Example

This repository demonstrates a basic offline face swap using the
[insightface](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface) library.

The provided `face_swap.py` script swaps the primary face from one image
onto another. The resulting image is synthetic. Use the script
responsibly and always disclose that the output is artificially
generated. Do not use it to harass, defame, or mislead others.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- insightface
- opencv-python

## Usage
```bash
python face_swap.py source.jpg target.jpg result.jpg
```
